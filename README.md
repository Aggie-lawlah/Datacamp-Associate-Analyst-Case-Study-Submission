# Datacamp-Associate-Analyst-Case-Study-Submission
For this project, I analysed a Pet Supplies dataset.
The dataset contained 8 columns and 1500 rows.
Mssing values and incorrect entries were resolved according to the instructions from the data dictionary
Four main questions(as instructed) were answered in this analysis;
  1. Are all column properties as described in the data dictionary
  2. What is the dstribution of purchase type
  3. What is the total sales distribution
  4. Is there a relatinship between sales and purchase type?

A summary of the insights generated from this dataset include;
* All the columns were not as descibed in the dataset library. some of the columns had to be tweaked to get the final column characteristic.
I ensured that all instructions regarding the conversion of variables to suit each column were srictly followed.

* Majority of the products were purchased repeatedly.

* Looking through the total sales distibutuion;
The category equipments had the highest amount of sales and accessory had the smallest number of sales.
Cat has the highest amount of sales while Bird had the lowest amount of sales.
Small had the highest amount of sales while Large had the lowest amount of sales.
On sales distribution by rating, more sales were rated 5, closely followed by 6 while the least rating was 1.7
* There is no relationship between sales and repeat purchase.
